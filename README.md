## Introduction

This provides a WYSIWYG editor for creating JSON based widgets that can be renderered via the [json_dynamic_widget](https://pub.dev/packages/json_dynamic_widget) package.  The editor supports a tree-based property-by-property editor or a full JSON based editor.  It also provides a renderer that can render the widget as the properties are being set.

On the right, the editor provides a help pane that will show any available documentation for the currently selected item in the left hand tree view.
